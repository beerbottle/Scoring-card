I have been with the company for close to 6 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Borrower added on 12/16/11 &gt; In addition to the other info provided I would like to add that a majority of our credit card debt was from overruns when we added an addition to our home.  Unfortunately to finish the job we needed to use credit cards as our home equity line was cut during after the real estate bubble burst.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Borrower added on 12/17/11 &gt; One more note regarding my credit card payments.  Currently I have close to $2000.00 dollars a month budgeted.

I'm also a big fan of the idea of Lending Club and would definitely like to participate as a lender in the future.  I think community based projects such as this are really the future, and a great way to help fellow people, rather than corporations.  I've got a steady job and am in no way in financial woes, but it would be nice to clear this debt as soon as possible, which is why I'm requesting this loan.   \n",

I am a student (senior standing) in Southwest Florida who is looking for a loan to supplement what my federal loans could not. I have a good credit score and have been working on it for 5 years now.   I will use this money to assist in paying my rent, books, and other tuition expenses. I have a part time job and my federal loans to take care of the rest. I will not be spending any loaned money on materials that are not directly related to my education or means of living.   \n",

I finished my project, went home, and decided to come back to build a recycling plant here, to kinda save Uganda from itself (garbage is a major problem here).  So far, I've spent about $65,000 of my own money to buy machinery (from Taiwan), rent a factory site, and pay salaries for six workers, but would like to borrow $25,000 more for renovations to improve production capacity.  (Namely, new roof, new concrete floor, new doors--to prevent stealing, and two locking shipping containers to store recycled material before it's sold.)   \n",

I racked up debt on my credit cards buying a new computer, laptop, software, etc.... The business is taking off and I'm hiring my first full-time employee this week and will need to purchase another computer system and more software for him . This loan will be for both consolidating my current credit card debts and also enabling me to purchase the equipment I need for my new employee. In addition it will get me through the upcoming transitional/expansion period of already having to much work to do on my own and having to train my new employee to being able to take on more jobs in the next 3-5 weeks.

People loved my baked goodies so much, that they began ordering on a more regular basis. Recently, I have had to turn down some orders because my little dough maker and conventional oven are not enough.   I plan to use the borrowed money to buy an industrial oven and a bigger dough mixer, which would make my job easier. I foresee these additions would double my production, and my business would really take off.   \n",

I wish to redirect my efforts at retiring my debt via another more-reasonable means.    I have sufficient funds to direct to this end on a monthly basis, and have simply gotten tired of their being gobbled up by interest and fees.   \n",
